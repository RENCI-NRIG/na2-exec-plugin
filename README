This is an exec plugin for NA2. It executes scripts (bash/python/etc) for each of the Plugin methods. Properties from handlers are passed in as environment variables following the convention that "some.property" becomes SOME_PROPERTY environment variable. 

The join script is assumed to take no command line parameters. The leave/modify/renew/status scripts take as the last parameter the reservation id. The rest of the parameters are passed in as environment variables. 

Upon return each script returns a status string (via echo) formatted as:

status_string ::= <OK | ERROR> [<status message>]; <reservation_id>

The plugin deals with changes in reservation id (e.g. in case of a renew that is break/make) by creating a new property "new.reservationid" or, equivalently, environment variable NEW_RESERVATIONID.

The plugin is configured using the following properties: exec.join, exec.leave, exec.modify, exec.renew which are paths and first few command line parameters of individual scripts, e.g. "/path/to/join.sh -a"

There is an optional exec.wd property that can set the working directory for the scripts if necessary.
